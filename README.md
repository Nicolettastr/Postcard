As part of my web development training at 4Geeks Academy, I completed a project where I designed a postcard using HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to develop my skills in web design and apply them to a fun and engaging activity.

Using HTML and CSS, I designed the layout and styling of the postcard, including the background, images, and text. I learned how to use CSS properties to adjust the positioning and styling of different elements on the page, and how to use HTML tags to structure the content and add semantic meaning.
